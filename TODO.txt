DONE #1. add an argument parser to filter_sam_file.py

DONE #2. add an argument parser to place_snps.py

#3. add unittests to:
DONE	- cigarparse - have these in a ifmain at the bottom of the file.
DONE	- filter sam file - put this in a 'tests.py' file
DONE	- cleanup the input/output for place_snps.py
DONE	-unittest the place_snps.py functions

DONE #9 get the cool green passing things on your github

DONE #10 add liscence


FINAL STEPS:
DONE- make the .vcf output for the files to be compared against
DONE- finish unittest for place_snps
DONE- update the docs
- add some more fringe cases to example data in tests
